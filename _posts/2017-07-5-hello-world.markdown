Hi, it's official blog for <code>Impression</code>, a C# cross platform game toolkit to create 2D and 3D games. Currently, <code>Impression</code> runs on all major platforms like desktop and mobile.

On future occasions, this blog will provide information on the development of <code>Impression</code>. For example the launch of the official release, serial tutorials, as well as all the problems and solutions encountered.

Slowly I attempt to provide an informative and easy-to-understand documentation of <code>Impression</code> usage. If you have any questions, please post them at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/Impression), [gamedev.stackexchange](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/Impression), or send an email to <a href="mailto:pratama.bayu@hotmail.com">pratama.bayu@hotmail.com</a>.
