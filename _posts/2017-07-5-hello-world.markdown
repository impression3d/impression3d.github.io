Hi, it's official blog for <code>Impression</code>, a C# cross platform game toolkit to create 2D and 3D games. Currently, it runs on all major platforms like desktop and mobile.

On future occasions, this blog will provide information on the development of impression3d. For example the launch of the official release, serial tutorials, as well as all the problems and solutions encountered.

Slowly I attempt to provide an informative and easy-to-understand documentation of impression3d usage. In addition I realize that it needs a place for discussion (forum) to discuss specifically about impression3d. The discussion places will help the development of impression3d user community. Let's see what I can do to make it happen, especially in the near future. In the meantime if anything needs to be asked can be through [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/Impression), [gamedev.stackexchange](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/Impression), or send an email to me.
